*monkey scripts for Lemmy

This is a small respository for Grease/Tamper/Violent (etc.) monkey scripts.

There are currently two versions:
- old.reddit -- this is a fairly loose interpretation and is represented in the screenshot below.
- old.reddit.compact -- a much (MUCH) tighter implementation of the above.
