*monkey scripts for Lemmy

This is a small respository for Grease/Tamper/Violent (etc.) monkey scripts.

There are currently two versions:
- old.reddit.user.js -- this is a fairly loose interpretation and is represented in the screenshot below.
- old.reddit.compact.user.js -- a much (MUCH) tighter implementation of the above.

This script is (or should be) theme agnostic.  It has been tested with darlkly, darkly-red, litely, and litely-red.

## Installation

1. Click your desired script from the shared code
2. Click the "Raw" button at on the top right of the script header area
3. Proceed according to the instructions for your userscript manager
